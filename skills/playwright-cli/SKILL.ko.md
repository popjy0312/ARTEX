# playwright-cli를 사용한 브라우저 자동화

## 빠른 시작

```bash
# open new browser
playwright-cli open
# navigate to a page
playwright-cli goto https://playwright.dev
# interact with the page using refs from the snapshot
playwright-cli click e15
playwright-cli type "page.click"
playwright-cli press Enter
# take a screenshot (rarely used, as snapshot is more common)
playwright-cli screenshot
# close the browser
playwright-cli close
```

## 명령

### 핵심

```bash
playwright-cli open
# open and navigate right away
playwright-cli open https://example.com/
playwright-cli goto https://playwright.dev

playwright-cli snapshot
# search the snapshot for text or a regexp, returns matching nodes with surrounding context
playwright-cli find "Sign in"
playwright-cli find --regex "Sign (in|up)"
# wrap the regexp in slashes to add flags, e.g. /i for case-insensitive
playwright-cli find --regex "/sign (in|up)/i"
playwright-cli eval "document.title"
playwright-cli eval "el => el.textContent" e5
# get element id, class, or any attribute not visible in the snapshot

### 스토리지

```bash
playwright-cli state-save
playwright-cli state-save auth.json
playwright-cli state-load auth.json

# Cookies
playwright-cli cookie-list
playwright-cli cookie-list --domain=example.com
playwright-cli cookie-get session_id

playwright-cli route "https://api.example.com/**" --body='{"mock": true}'
playwright-cli route-list
playwright-cli unroute "**/*.jpg"
playwright-cli unroute
```

### DevTools

```bash
playwright-cli console
playwright-cli console warning
playwright-cli requests
playwright-cli request 5
playwright-cli run-code "async page => await page.context().grantPermissions(['geolocation'])"
playwright-cli run-code --filename=script.js
playwright-cli tracing-start
playwright-cli tracing-stop
playwright-cli video-start video.webm
playwright-cli video-chapter "Chapter Title" --description="Details" --duration=2000
playwright-cli video-stop

# annotate each subsequent action (click, type, ...) with a callout naming the action and highlighting the target
playwright-cli video-show-actions --duration=600 --position=top-right
playwright-cli video-hide-actions

# launch the dashboard for UI review / design feedback — user annotates the page, you receive the annotated screenshot, snapshot, and notes
playwright-cli show --annotate

# generate a Playwright locator for an element from its ref or selector
playwright-cli generate-locator e5 --raw

# show a persistent highlight overlay for an element, optionally with a custom style
playwright-cli highlight e5
playwright-cli highlight e5 --style="outline: 3px dashed red"
# hide a single element highlight, or all page highlights when no target is given
playwright-cli highlight e5 --hide
playwright-cli highlight --hide
```

## 원시 출력

전역 `--raw` 옵션은 페이지 상태, 생성 코드 및 스냅샷 섹션을 출력에서 제거하고 결과 값만 반환합니다. 명령이 출력하지 않는 경우 아무것도 반환하지 않습니다.

명령 출력을 다른 도구로 파이프할 때 사용합니다.

```bash
playwright-cli --raw eval "JSON.stringify(performance.timing)" | jq '.loadEventEnd - .navigationStart'
playwright-cli --raw eval "JSON.stringify([...document.querySelectorAll('a')].map(a => a.href))" > links.json
playwright-cli --raw snapshot > before.yml
playwright-cli click e5
playwright-cli --raw snapshot > after.yml
diff before.yml after.yml
TOKEN=$(playwright-cli --raw cookie-get session_id)
playwright-cli --raw localstorage-get theme
```

모든 응답을 JSON으로 감싸 구조화된 출력으로 받으려면 `--json`을 전달합니다.

```bash
playwright-cli list --json
```

## open 매개변수

```bash
# Use specific browser when creating session
playwright-cli open --browser=chrome
playwright-cli open --browser=firefox
playwright-cli open --browser=webkit
playwright-cli open --browser=msedge

# Emulate a generic mobile device (Pixel 10 for Chromium, iPhone 17 for WebKit).
# Prefer this when a mobile layout is acceptable: mobile pages are usually
# lighter, so snapshots are smaller and cheaper.
playwright-cli open --mobile
playwright-cli open --device="iPhone 15"

# Use persistent profile (by default profile is in-memory)
playwright-cli open --persistent
# Use persistent profile with custom directory
playwright-cli open --profile=/path/to/profile

# Connect to browser via Playwright Extension
playwright-cli attach --extension=chrome

# Connect to a running Chrome or Edge by channel name
playwright-cli attach --cdp=chrome
playwright-cli attach --cdp=msedge

# Connect to a running browser via CDP endpoint
playwright-cli attach --cdp=http://localhost:9222

# Start with config file
playwright-cli open --config=my-config.json

# Close the browser
playwright-cli close
# Detach from an attached browser (leaves the external browser running)
playwright-cli -s=msedge detach
# Delete user data for the default session
playwright-cli delete-data
```

## Windows에서 `&`가 포함된 URL

Windows에서는 `cmd.exe`와 PowerShell이 `&`를 명령 구분자로 처리하므로, 여러 쿼리 매개변수가 있는 URL이 `playwright-cli`를 실행하기 전에 잘립니다. `cmd.exe`에서는 `&`를 `^&`로 이스케이프하고, PowerShell에서는 `--%`를 사용합니다.

```batch
playwright-cli goto "https://example.com/?a=1^&b=2"
```

```powershell
playwright-cli --% goto "https://example.com/?a=1&b=2"
```

## 스냅샷

각 명령 후 `playwright-cli`는 현재 브라우저 상태의 스냅샷을 제공합니다.

```bash
> playwright-cli goto https://example.com
### Page
- Page URL: https://example.com/
- Page Title: Example Domain
### Snapshot
[Snapshot](.playwright-cli/page-2026-02-14T19-22-42-679Z.yml)
```

`playwright-cli snapshot` 명령으로 필요할 때도 스냅샷을 찍을 수 있습니다. 아래 옵션은 필요에 따라 조합할 수 있습니다.

```bash
# default - save to a file with timestamp-based name
playwright-cli snapshot

# save to file, use when snapshot is a part of the workflow result
playwright-cli snapshot --filename=after-click.yaml

# snapshot an element instead of the whole page
playwright-cli snapshot "#main"

# limit snapshot depth for efficiency, take a partial snapshot afterwards
playwright-cli snapshot --depth=4
playwright-cli snapshot e34

# include each element's bounding box as [box=x,y,width,height]
playwright-cli snapshot --boxes

# search a large snapshot instead of capturing it all — returns matching nodes
# with 3 lines of context around each match (like grep -C)
playwright-cli find "Add to cart"
playwright-cli find --regex "\\$[0-9]+\\.[0-9]{2}"
```

## 요소 지정

기본적으로 스냅샷의 ref를 사용해 페이지 요소와 상호작용합니다.

```bash
# get snapshot with refs
playwright-cli snapshot

# interact using a ref
playwright-cli click e15
```

CSS selector 또는 Playwright locator를 사용할 수도 있습니다.

```bash
# css selector
playwright-cli click "#main > button.submit"

# role locator
playwright-cli click "getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })"

# test id
playwright-cli click "getByTestId('submit-button')"
```

## 브라우저 세션

```bash
# create new browser session named "mysession" with persistent profile
playwright-cli -s=mysession open example.com --persistent
# same with manually specified profile directory (use when requested explicitly)
playwright-cli -s=mysession open example.com --profile=/path/to/profile
playwright-cli -s=mysession click e6
playwright-cli -s=mysession close  # stop a named browser
playwright-cli -s=mysession delete-data  # delete user data for persistent session

playwright-cli list
# Close all browsers
playwright-cli close-all
# Forcefully kill all browser processes
playwright-cli kill-all
```

## 설치

전역 `playwright-cli` 명령을 사용할 수 없으면 `npx playwright cli`로 로컬 버전을 시도합니다.

```bash
npx --no-install playwright --version
```

로컬 버전을 사용할 수 있으면 모든 명령에 `npx playwright cli`를 사용합니다. 그렇지 않으면 `playwright-cli`를 전역 명령으로 설치합니다.

```bash
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
```

## 예시: 폼 제출

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com/form
playwright-cli snapshot

playwright-cli fill e1 "user@example.com"
playwright-cli fill e2 "password123"
playwright-cli click e3
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli close
```

## 예시: 여러 탭 워크플로

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli tab-new https://example.com/other
playwright-cli tab-list
playwright-cli tab-select 0
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli close
```

## 예시: DevTools로 디버깅

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli click e4
playwright-cli fill e7 "test"
playwright-cli console
playwright-cli requests
playwright-cli close
```

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli tracing-start
playwright-cli click e4
playwright-cli fill e7 "test"
playwright-cli tracing-stop
playwright-cli close
```

## 예시: 대화형 세션

UI 검토 또는 디자인 피드백을 사용자에게 요청합니다. 사용자는 실제 페이지에 상자를 그리고 의견을 입력하며, 에이전트는 주석이 달린 스크린샷, 표시 영역의 스냅샷 및 사용자의 메모를 받습니다. 사용자가 “UI review”, “design feedback” 또는 “ask the user what they think / want / mean”을 요청하면 이를 사용합니다.

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli show --annotate
```
